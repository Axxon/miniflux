How does Miniflux update my feeds from the user interface?
----------------------------------------------------------

Miniflux uses an Ajax request to refresh each subscription.
By default, there is only 5 feeds updated in parallel.

I have 600 subscriptions, can Miniflux handle that?
---------------------------------------------------

Probably, but your life is cluttered.

Why are there no categories? Why is feature X missing?
------------------------------------------------------

Miniflux is a minimalist software. Less is more.

I found a bug, what next?
-------------------------

Report the bug to the [issues tracker](https://github.com/fguillot/miniflux/issues) and I will fix it.

You can report feeds that doesn't works properly too.

What browser is compatible with Miniflux?
------------------------------------------

Miniflux is tested with the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari.

I don't use Microsoft products, and as such I have no idea if Miniflux works correctly with Internet Explorer.
